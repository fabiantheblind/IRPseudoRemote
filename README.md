IRPseudo Remote.
================

So you bought that shiny Apple Remote and learnd at home that
your shiny MacBook Air has no IR reciever?  
Luckily you can build something like it yourself.  

----------

Use the [Sparkfun Arduino Pro Micro](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12640) and an IR reciever. I used this [Sparkfun IR Breakout Board.](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8554) Also you'll need  the [Arduino-IRRemote Library.](https://github.com/shirriff/Arduino-IRremote)  

----------

based on  
IRremote: IRrecvDemo - demonstrates receiving IR codes with IRrecv
An IR detector/demodulator must be connected to the input RECV_PIN.
